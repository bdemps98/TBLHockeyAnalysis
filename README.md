# TBL Hockey Analysis

## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to further enhance my proficiency in Python programming and data analysis. I've chosen to focus on the Tampa Bay Lightning hockey team as the subject of analysis. The rationale behind this choice stems from my fascination with sports statistics and the insights they can provide. By delving into the data of my favorite team, I aim to extract meaningful stories and narratives from the statistics.

## Why Tampa Bay Lightning?

The Tampa Bay Lightning is a captivating subject for analysis due to their dynamic performance and achievements in the world of hockey. The team's statistics and player data offer a rich source of information to explore various facets of the game. As an avid fan of the Tampa Bay Lightning, I am excited to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and stories that lie within the numbers.

By conducting a thorough analysis of the team's performance, player statistics, and other relevant data, I hope to gain valuable insights into the factors that contribute to the team's success. This project not only provides an opportunity for skill development but also offers a chance to appreciate the intricate narratives that sports statistics can reveal.

Through this project, I aim to deepen my knowledge in Python programming, data manipulation, and analysis techniques. By combining my passion for hockey and data analysis, I'm excited to embark on this journey of exploration and discovery.

**Note:** This project is purely for educational and personal purposes. It's a demonstration of how data analysis can be applied to gain insights from sports statistics, and it's not affiliated with the Tampa Bay Lightning organization or the NHL.
